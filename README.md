# 2D_DUNGEON_GAME
Introduction to the 2D Java Game

Welcome to my exciting 2D platformer game project, developed in Java. In this game, you take control of a character who can move around, jump, and interact with the environment. This repository is your gateway to exploring, collaborating, and contributing to the development of this game.

Key Features:

Smooth Movement: Experience fluid character movement with responsive controls.

Jumping Action: Precisely navigate through the game world using a well-tuned jumping mechanism.

Accurate Collisions: Interact realistically with the game world, thanks to the implementation of hit boxes.

Development Approach:

We've built this game using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to create a clean and extensible codebase. We've also implemented design patterns to keep our code organized and ready for future enhancements.
